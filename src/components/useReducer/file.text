useReducer returns an array that holds the
current state value and a dispatch function 
to which you can pass an action and later 
invoke it. While this is similar to the 
pattern Redux uses, there are a few differences.
For example, the useReducer function is 
tightly coupled to a specific reducer.

It is an extension to useState.
