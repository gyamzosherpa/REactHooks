useState: useState is a Hook that allows you to have state 
variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value

eg:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Here,   count = state variable,
        setCount = state function
        zero inside useStae is a initial value
